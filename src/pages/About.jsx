          I recently successfully completed the intensive four-month full-time
          Software Engineering Certificate Program at Per Scholas, an important
          step in my journey towards a career in software development.

          Before I started this journey on becoming a software developer I
          worked a full time job
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I usually playing video games, listening to music
          or watching anime.
